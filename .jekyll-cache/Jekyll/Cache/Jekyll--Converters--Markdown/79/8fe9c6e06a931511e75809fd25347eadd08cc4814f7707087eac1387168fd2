<p>The wttr.in API is a weather forecast service primarily targeted to consoles. This API is able to represent weather forecast information in the following formats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ANSI sequences for console HTTP clients, including curl, httpie, and wget.</li>
  <li>HTML for web browsers</li>
  <li>PNG for graphical viewers</li>
</ul>

<p>wttr.in relies on the <a href="https://github.com/schachmat/wego">wego weather client</a> to display weather information. Weather forecast data is pulled from multiple resources.</p>
